# polygraphene-phonon-localization-MD
This repository contains sample LAMMPS simulation script to generate the Dynamical matrix useful for phonon calculations in polycrystalline graphene model, along with the associated python analysis script that uses the outputs from lammps simulation as well as from the "PHANA" package by Prof. Lingti Kong (github repository at lingtikong/phana).
